## 6. Rulings (copy to docs/DECISIONS.md)

Ruled by Zach Pressley, October 14, 2026, unless marked as proposed. Proposed items are recommendations Zach has not yet confirmed. Treat them as open.

**Q1. Movement rate vs. round length.** With 25m tiles, the 40×40 map is only 1 km square, and formed infantry covers about half of it in one 10-minute order. Ruling: keep 25m tiles and make the map much bigger. The game is no longer bound by Discord's limits. Exact size is set in Stage 1. *Proposed:* map size is a per-scenario setting starting around 200×200 (5 km), and the engine uses numeric x,y coordinates internally while players mostly refer to landmarks.

**Q2. Old code archival.** Tag `legacy-final`, then move retired code into `archive/` on `main` with a README. Nothing is deleted.

**Q3. Officer death rate.** *Proposed:* tie risk to exposure instead of a flat rate (low while holding, higher in melee, highest when the unit routs or is overrun), with wounded or captured coming before death in most cases. Playtest targets of roughly 1 in 20 to 30 battles on a winning side and 1 in 5 on a side that routs.

**Q4. Weapon effectiveness.** The engine supports both multipliers and flat bonuses, because having both gives more ways to weight the game. Values come from playtesting. What must be fixed in the spec is how and when each applies. *Proposed:* flat bonuses add to the base value first, then multipliers apply to that total, always in that order.

**Q5. Attacker and defender.** Removed permanently. Two units fighting are both attacking; neither role means anything. Units are Side 1 and Side 2. Advantage comes from position and circumstance: a unit coming down a hill gains, a unit in a worse position is penalized, an ambushed unit is penalized, and chaos and preparedness apply as already designed. Charge momentum belongs to the unit that moved into contact. A guard test keeps role language out of the engine.

**Q6. Unit size and tile capacity.** Armies run from a few hundred to about 1,000 per side. Combat math must be scale-invariant: casualties work as proportions, so 300 against 300 plays the same as 25 against 25, while casualty rates stay realistic and every clash feels like it matters. Units stay small enough that each one's commander has a visible effect; very large units would need several commanders and blur that.

**Q7. Tribal Warriors.** A faction-specific unit (for example, Germanic tribes). Same cost and same fighting ability as Militia, plus a morale bonus so they fight longer and rout less. Effectively fiercely loyal militia.

**Q8. The `training` field.** Removed from the army builder for now. Training tier comes from the quality ladder. Buying training may come back later as a purchase.

**Damage system.** The formula in `combat_design_parameters.md` is inverted against its worked examples. The tested damage rebuild on the recovered branch is the starting point. Where code, tests and worked examples agree, fix the doc to match. Where they disagree, log it for Zach.

**Not yet ruled.** Whether commander quality and unit quality are separate stats (proposed: separate, with the quality ladder governing how a unit fights and the commander governing how deep an order it can execute), and the player-facing coordinate format.
