// Does every game end? Plays many hotseat games with silent commanders: each
// side gives one opening order (or none) and then leaves its units to their
// orders and standing orders. A game that has not ended after 60 player
// turns is stuck, and the run fails. The closed-loop meeting battle must also
// reach a verdict on every seed. No time limit is set, so a game ends only
// by the fighting.
//

//                                50 meeting battles
//   npm run soak -- --seeds 50
